Build a game in a single HTML file. Do not use any libs, just pure js and html code. 
The game takes place on a 3x3 grid, where the players take turns clicking an empty grid square. 
Player 1 places AXA in the square when they click on an empty square.
Player 2 places KON in the square when they click on an empty square.
The goal is to get 3 of a kind in a row, either AXA or KON. 
If there are 3 AXA in a row, player 1 wins.
If there are 3 KON in a row, player 2 wins.

Don't explain anything, just provide the game.
