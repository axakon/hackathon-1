Build a game in a single HTML file. Do not use any libs, just pure js and html code.
The title of the game is The Witcher 4.
The game takes place on a 3x3 grid with equal spacing between the grid squares, where the players take turns clicking an empty grid square. 
The grid should take up half of the viewport.
The square should take up most of the grid visually.
Display the title over the grid.
Center the grid in the viewport.
Player 1 places AXA in the square when they click on an empty square.
Player 2 places KON in the square when they click on an empty square.
The goal is to get 3 of a kind in a row, either AXA or KON. 
If there are 3 AXA in a row, player 1 wins.
If there are 3 KON in a row, player 2 wins.
If a player wins, provide a victory alert stating who won.
If the grid is full, and neither player has won, provide an alert saying the game has resulted in a draw.
Before providing the an alert, render the AXA or KON in the clicked square.
If there is a victory alert, highlight the winning row.
Restart the game when either alert has been dismissed.

Don't explain anything, just provide the game.
