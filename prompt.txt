I'm using HTML and pure JavaScript to write a game with the following rules:
- 2 players 
- The game has a 3x3 grid
- The game is turn-based
- One player wins when they have 3 tokens placed on the grid that form a straight line (horizontal, vertical or diagonal)
- If no possible moves are left for either player, have a button that can reset the board
- When a player wins, show a cool win message using Alert() and reset the game board when the Alert is accepted. Wait 1 second before showing the alert
- Player 1 has the token "AXA" and player 2 has the token "KON"
- Player 2 should be a selectable AI opponent. It is selected using a button at the start of the game. The player starting is random when using AI opponent. The AI should use the MinMax algorithm. 
- Please use pretty colors and make it look kinda cool

Please put all code in the same file, with no external dependencies. Please do not write anything other than the resulting code in your answer. Do not explain anything.
