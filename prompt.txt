generate a 3 x 3 clickable square grid game
with the goal of collecting 3 boxes in a row

for example when one player gets 3 of it's symbols in a row, vertically, horizontally or diagonally they win
otherwise the game continues until all boxes are taken, that results in a draw





clicking a square should fill it in for that player with it's player symbol

use AXA and KON as player symbols when a box is clicked

players alternate taking one turn each

only use HTML, css and javascript

please put all the code in one file without external dependencies, and dont explain anything
